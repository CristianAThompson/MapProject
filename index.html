            Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
            but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period
            so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you
            this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
            too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
