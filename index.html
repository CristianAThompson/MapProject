            The wars of Alexander the Great were fought by King Alexander III of
             Macedon ("The Great"), first against the Achaemenid Persian Empire
             under Darius III, and then against local chieftains and warlords as
              far east as Punjab, India. Alexander the Great was one of the most
              successful military commanders of all time. He was undefeated in
              battle. By the time of his death, he had conquered most of the world
               known to the ancient Greeks. Although being successful as a
               military commander, he failed to provide any stable alternative
               to the Achaemenid Empireâ€”his untimely death threw the vast
               territories he conquered into civil war.

            Alexander assumed the kingship of Macedon following the death of his
             father Philip II, who had unified most of the city-states of
             mainland Greece under Macedonian hegemony in a federation called
             the League of Corinth.[4] After reconfirming Macedonian rule by
             uashing a rebellion of southern Greek city-states and staging a
             short but bloody excursion against Macedon's northern neighbors,
             Alexander set out east against the Achaemenid Persian Empire,
             under its "King of Kings" (the title all Achaemenid kings went by),
              Darius III, which he defeated and overthrew. His conquests
              included Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Judea, Gaza, Egypt, Bactria,
              and Mesopotamia, and he extended the boundaries of his own empire
              as far as Punjab, India.

            Alexander had already made more plans prior to his death for military
             and mercantile expansions into the Arabian Peninsula, after which he
              was to turn his armies to the west (Carthage, Rome, and the Iberian
               Peninsula). However, Alexander's diadochi quietly abandoned
               these grandiose plans after his death. Instead, within a few years
                of Alexander's death, the diadochi began fighting with each other,
                 dividing up the Empire between themselves, and triggering 40
                 years of warfare.
